We are using the universal selector here to apply to all
We are adding margin and padding to the page to make sure
it is consistent across all browsers. Sometimes browsers
add their own margin and padding to the page. 

"box-sizing: border-box" is changing our box model. 
This makes it so that the borders and the padding are no longer added
to the total width or total height that we specify for a box.
So, without this, any padding or borders are added to the
height and the width of an element which isn't helpfulf for us
